Today, Vyral Marketing VP of Business Development, Scott Sillari interviews Dr. DelRae Messer. She’s the founder and owner of Practice Acceleration Systems, a consulting company for chiropractors. She’s currently focusing on a Detox program and has been featured on in several publications, including ShopNBC and Suzanne Summers, for her entrepreneurial accomplishments. In this episode, she stresses the importance of personal branding and self-marketing.

“At the end of the day, you need to stop talking and listen to what people want.”


Dr. DelRae Messer knew from an early age she didn’t want to put a band-aid on health programs. Although she admits her athletic talents aren’t her best quality, her mindset is ultimately the reason for her chiropractic passion and entrepreneurial successes.

After being exposed to black mold and getting sick from it in graduate school, she found her passion for cellular cleansing and environmental toxicity. That’s when she began changing the way she looked at chemicals, which she calls the “millennial piece of the puzzle” she missed for so long. Particularly, she experienced an incredible shift once she began eating whole foods for a lifelong, healthy lifestyle, not just a diet.

In her business, she stresses the importance of not only marketing your business, but your personality. Determine how you incorporate your personal brand into your entrepreneurial pursuits, and how to sell your services to prospective clients. Chiropractic is a relationship-based business, which requires constant networking. When you meet someone for the first time, they should understand your business’s personality through your own personal brand. Tap into their perceptions of your business through your own self-presentation.

Dr. DelRae Messer is a licensed chiropractic in the Great Minneapolis-St. Paul area. She is the owner and founder of Practice Acceleration Systems, a consulting company for chiropractors, and sells Detox products through a weight-loss program. She received her Doctorate in Chiropractic from Northwestern Health Sciences University in Bloomington, Minnesota.

Her passion for health, wellness and nutrition began from her career as a student athlete. However, her life changed when she got sick in graduate school from black mold. She transitioned towards a whole foods diet and learned about environmental toxicity.
